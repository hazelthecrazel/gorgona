<p align="center"><b/>Basic Information</b>:
</br></br>
<p align="left"><b/>Name</b> : Vashj<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Age</b> : Roughly 3000 years old<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Height </b>: 5'3<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Race</b> : Gorgon<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Alias</b> : None<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Rank</b> : Paige<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Magic Tree</b> : Wizardry<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Appearance</b> : Vashj's body is one to be desired. With a body that could stop a truck, and a face that could rival an Angel's, she truly is a sight to behold.  Her most noticeable feature is that instead of having hair, she holds the iconic head of living snakes that gorgons are known for. These snakes are almost completely white except for their rose gold undertones, making for a deadly yet beautiful look. Vashj has a widow's peak, her hairline covered in scattered white scales. <p>
<p align="left"> She has a distinct combination of both a Latina and Russian facial structure despite being of ancient Greek origin. Her face is small, her cheekbones being the widest part which causes her face to have a heart-like shape. She has a slightly wide nose with plump pink lips. Her eyes are the color of storm clouds with long lashes that add for a sultry effect. Vashj has a slight hourglass shape, the ideal body shape for women that leaves her looking that much more appealing with long and elegant legs. 
​ <p>
<p align="left"><b/>Personality</b> : Vashj is often considered to be a flirtatious individual, however this is just an intricate facade. She is like this to lure in prey, and in reality, she relishes in the pain she inflicts upon those who succumb to her. It's like an addictive drug that she can't get over. She is, however, able to control herself around the public so that she may not give herself away and reveal what she really is.<p>
<p align="left">She normally keeps on a resting bitch face that may appear oddly attractive with the slight part of her lips at the center and her bedroom eyes. She isn't entirely a horrible person, though. To those she respects she holds a deep care for, and may even be as loyal as a soldier towards them.<p>
</div>
 
<div id="tab2" style="display:none">
 
<p align="left"><b/>Omnidirectional Vision</b> - Due to the mass of living serpents on her head, Vashj is able to see through their eyes, allowing her to see everything happening around her.  She may control these snakes to look where she wants them to, but if one of them are cut off or rendered useless, it slightly affects her 360 degree vision and takes several days to grow back.<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Dermal Armor</b> - Although she is no longer covered in scales as she had once been, her skin still retains their strength. This causes her skin to have an iron durability, but her bones are still of human durability.<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Prime Condition</b> - Vashj's body is extremely physically and mentally fit, causing her to be faster, stronger, have faster reflexes, more acute senses, and even be more intelligent than the average human being. ( 2x increase )
<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Poison</b> - The Gorgon has two razor sharp fangs that can easily pierce tin defenses and sink into skin. These fangs secrete a venom that Vashj is immune to, but if coming into contact with any other living being's bloodstream it will begin to quite literally boil their blood to a degree. This is extremely painful and lasts for up to 3 posts after being bitten.
<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Petrifying Gaze</b> - After two posts of direct eye contact, the living being that looks will begin to experience slight paralysis in their legs and arms, rendering them slightly immobile for one post. They can not be affected by this for the next five posts, however and only has an affect while Vashj's body is producing adrenaline and is triggered for the victim via rising body heat.<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Poisonous Blood</b> - Vashj's blood is extremely toxic, and anything that ingests it or gets it into their blood will begin to feel extreme pain. If vomiting is induced, the pain will spread through their entire esophagus. This can be cured by a faith mage of at least mage rank via a toxin cleansing spell.<P>
<p align="left"><b/>Toxin Immunity</b> - Since her body produces so much poison, it is naturally highly resistant to it.<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Snake Physiology</b> - Vashj's tongue is forked, like a snake's, and she may use this tongue to detect movement in the air around her in up to a thirty foot radius. The soles of her feet are also highly sensitive, allowing her to feel vibrations in the ground.<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Cold Weakness</b> - As a serpent herself, her body rejects the cold. If she is subjected to the cold for too long it will affect her ability to taste the air with her tongue and even reduce her speed to base human speed. ( Faith buffs are not affected ) -- 2x weakness to cryomancy spells and 2x weaker to viruses and bacteria that breed in the cold.<p>

<p align="center"><b/>Mana Manipulation and Universal Spells</b><p><p>
<p align="left"><b/>Mana Manipulation</b>: The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.<p><p>
<p align="left"><b/>Vashj's mana</b>, when visible to the naked eye, appears as a rosey pink shade like a flower. It rolls off of her body in thick clouds when using spells like Show of Power., and flecks of gold may be seen flittering amongst her aura.<p>
<p align="center"><b/>Universal Spells</b> -<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Mana Weave</b>: The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana<p>
<p align="left"><b/>Mana Spark</b>: A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.<p>
</div>
 
<div id="tab4" style="display:none">
 
<p align="center"><b/>Spells and Items</b><p><p>
<P align="left"><b/>Wizardry</b> : It's debatable that Wizardry offers more utility than any other tree. They provide a number of banes and boons through the use of Artifacts, Curses, Hexes and Potions, but lack a lot of fire power when in comparison to most of the other trees. Artifacts are, for lack of a better word, enchanted objects that can provide passive, or temporary/activated, buffs to the wielder or affect a given area upon being activated. Curses are banes to be cast on other people that can inflict a number of status effects on them. They're capable of doing damage, but only to a limited extent, and can not actually have the capacity to kill until High Mage. A hex is a spell that places an effect on a given item, and can be placed on multiple items. Potions are, as you might have guessed, a concoction of different ingredients that must be gathered prior to making the potion that might provide a desired effect when consumed, or act as a poison. Wizards are also, outside of faith mages, the only mages that can remove curses.​<p>
<p align="center"><b/>Items</b> - <p>
<P align="left">N o n e<p>
<p>
<p align="center"><b/>Wizardry Spells</b> - <p>
<p align="center"><b/>Potions</b>
<P align="left"><b/>Bubbly Blood</b> - With the aid of her blood and several other ingredients, Vashj is able to create a dangerous potion. Due to being infused with her blood, the liquidous potion will begin to sting and itch as soon as coming into contact with the skin but will not actually do enough damage to melt away skin. If this potion enters the blood stream it will begin to thin out the blood itself, creating wounds that bleed continuously until they are healed and the thinning agents from the other ingredients are cured. These potions are kept inside of thin glass vials that can be easily broken with enough force. Ingredients Required : Tree Ear Mushrooms, Vashj's own Gorgon Blood,  Tree Sap, Poison Ivy leaves.<p>
<P align="left"><b/>Nasty Bite</b> - After harvesting some of her own venom from her fangs, Vashj has knowledge enough to turn this into a nasty potion. Her venom, while not nearly as strong as a dreadsnake's, has similar burning properties when entering the body. It doesn't dissolve flesh or skin but it does hurt like all hell. The adhesive gathered from the Verna Aloe plant causes the blood to become thicker and allows it to stick to the skin. Much like Bubbly Blood, these potions are kept inside of thin glass vials that may easily be broken with enough force. Ingredients Required: Vashj's Venom, Verna Aloe Adhesive.<p>
<P align="left"><b/>Healthy Girl</b> - A potion consisting of Syl Flower sap, Water, and Echinacea. Once ingested, the potion will begin to send the recipient's white blood cell production into overdrive, while also encasing them in a thick outer layer that bolsters their immune system's strength. This helps ward off bacterial infections caused by harmful spores, viruses, or poisons to some extent. This potion's effect wears off after two posts and are encapsulated in small vials with thick leather covering to prevent damage to the glass within but may still be destroyed rather easily. <p>
